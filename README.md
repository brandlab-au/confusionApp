# ConfusionApp
## This project utilizes grunt
**grunt serve**
-Projet utilizes angular 

-This site was built using
[angularRoute bower install angular-router -S](http://bower.io/)

- Active files in app dir
- The 3 html pages are not showing using ng-view
- you can see they work with ng-include
- Controller setup MenuController 
- Problem is probably the injection dependency of ngRouter
- Data in services js
- More data needs to be moved to sevices for DishController

- [ ] Finish angular view problem.
- [ ] Push my comments to GitHub.
- [ ] Then move data all to services.
